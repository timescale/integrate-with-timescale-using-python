# Setup analytics for IOT devices

Let us imagine that your business is delivering time-sensitive medical supplies
to doctors, hospitals and even ambulances on a call. You have a drone farm, and 
each drone can pick up and deliver boxes of supplies. For each drone you know its 
capacity, remaining power, and exact coordinates. On a perfect sunny day, you can 
deliver without a problem. Thanks to global heating, the weather is more and more 
unpredictable and you need to deliver through hell and high water. Maybe the 
conditions are so bad you need to send a courier.  You use analytics
to combine data from your IOT system with weather predictions and mapping data to 
ensure deliver in all conditions. 

This page shows you how to combine large amounts of real time data to automatically 
ensure medical supplies are always delivered on time.   

You can:
*  [Read the code](./link-to-file.sql) - see the code that implements this story.
*  [Read the docs](https://docs.timescale.com/tutorials/latest/) - follow the workflow and understand the call sequence.
