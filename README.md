# Integrate with Timescale using Python

Timescale is a high-performance developer focused cloud that provides PostgreSQL services enhanced with our blazing fast vector search.

Timescale services focus on three main use-cases:
* **Time-series and Analytics**: for lightning fast ingest and queries on time based workloads (like price, sensor, event, blockchain, or IoT data).
Powered by TimescaleDB, built for production, and extended with cloud features like transparent data tiering to object storage.

* **General purpose PostgreSQL**: for metadata, business information and traditional relational workloads.
Powered by Dynamic PostgreSQL. Operate within a CPU range and only pay for what you use.

* **Vector and AI**: for applications that require fast search on vector embeddings and metadata, like semantic search, image search, RAG and Agents.
Powered by Timescale Vector and available on Time-series and Dynamic PostgreSQL services.

You use this repo to setup your Timescale service, learn how to tune your data so you get the 
best bang for your buck, and implement use cases close to your business model. 

Clone the repo, run the use cases, then use the code in your app!
