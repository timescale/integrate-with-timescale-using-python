# Improve database performance

Hypertables are PostgreSQL tables with special features that make it easy to handle time-series data. 
Anything you can do with regular PostgreSQL tables, you can do with hypertables. 
In addition, Hypertables give improved performance and user experience for time-series data.

You can compress time-series data to reduce the amount of storage required, and increase the speed of some queries.

*  [Read the docs](https://docs.timescale.com/tutorials/latest/) - follow the workflow and understand the call sequence.
